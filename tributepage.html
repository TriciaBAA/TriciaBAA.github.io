            <i>Personally...</i>
            Schenck inspired me as an artist to bring out sorrow in the most innocent ways. The way depicted people's hardships in
            herds of sheeps really caught my attention. The way he is able to make the audience feel the pain even withput directly painting
            a face really gets to me. He is one of the artists that really caught my interest and I hope as you read this you become interested
            in his artworks too.
